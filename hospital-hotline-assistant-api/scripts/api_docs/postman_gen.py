"""Generate the Postman collections + environments (postman/ at repo root).

Two collections, both straight from the OpenAPI dumps — nothing hand-written:
  - ai-opd-prescreening-api  : our whole API, folders by URL prefix
  - his-integration          : ONLY the calls we make TO the hospital HIS
                               (adapter calls + the real iMed contract)

Built as Collection Format v2.1 (which is what maps cleanly from OpenAPI),
then converted to **v3 YAML** with `postman collection migrate` — Postman's
Local Mode dropped JSON support, so v3 is what the desktop app reads. The
CLI does the conversion rather than us hand-writing YAML, so the format is
always whatever Postman actually expects.

Ids are uuid5-derived so regenerating does not churn git. Auth is
collection-level bearer; public routes opt out with "noauth", so Postman's
Auth tab shows the truth per request.

contract. The contract itself is transcribed verbatim in

⚠️ `assign_spid` is a **placeholder** pending your master-data codes.

### Deliberately absent

| Field | Why |
|---|---|
| `queue_number` | you generate it — your queue rules own sequencing, prefixes and daily resets. We display what you return and the nurse hands it to the patient. |
| `base_department_id` | you derive it from the service point; one less code for us to keep in sync |
| `assign_eid` | we route to a *department*, never a named doctor. If any destination requires one, that is a product decision for us — see per-department question 2. |
| `sbar.assessment_equipment` | a clinical judgement our system does not make; left for the nurse |

### Where each value comes from

| iMed field | our source |
|---|---|
| `request_id` | allocated at nurse-confirm and **stored**; reused on retry, new one on a genuine reroute |
| `visit_id` | `session.metadata.visit.visit_id`, captured when the patient enters their VN at the booth |
| `assign_spid` | our department code → `department_map.CODE_TO_SPID` ⚠️ |
| `sbar.situation` | nurse-edited chief complaint, else `metadata.triage_classification.symptoms_summary` |
| `sbar.background` | `metadata.patient_history` (chronic_conditions, allergies, past_surgeries, family_history, smoking_alcohol) + age |
| `sbar.assessment` | `metadata.vitals` measured at the booth **+ the triage level** (it has nowhere else to go — see change request 1) |
| `sbar.assessment_problem` | `triage_classification.key_reason` + `disposition_reasons[].text_th` with its manual `citation` |
| `sbar.recommend` | destination department + urgency; a reroute is noted here because iMed has no `rerouted` flag |

SBAR is always sent in **Thai**, regardless of the language the patient used
at the booth.

### Timeout is not failure

Postman cannot express this as a saved example, so stated here: if this call
**times out**, we do not know whether the queue row was created. We record it
as `unknown` — never as failed — and any retry reuses the **same**
`request_id`, so it cannot double-book the patient. This is why change
requests 7 and 8 matter.

Identical to request 1, plus a single additive `mfu_prescreen` object.

One namespaced wrapper rather than loose top-level fields, for two reasons:
nothing here can collide with a field you add later, and there is no chance of
reading it as something we already send. **We are not asking you to adopt this
shape** — only to tell us where these values should live. If you would rather
have them flat, or under different names, say so; the values are the ask, not
the spelling.

| In `mfu_prescreen` | Change request | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `triage_level`, `triage_scale`, `triage_label` | **CR 1 — highest value** | The 5-level triage is our system's whole output. With no field it is buried in SBAR prose, so your destination queue sorts by arrival time instead of by how sick the patient is. `triage_level` is the integer 1–5 our engine already produces; `triage_scale` is `MOPH-5`, the Thai MOPH ED Triage 5-level guideline (กรมการแพทย์ 2561) our criteria are built on — see `docs/criteria-standards.md`. Name them whatever suits your schema; the value is what matters. |
| `vitals` (structured, with `measured_at` and `source`) | CR 2 | We measure with a real cuff at the booth and know whether a value was instrument-measured or patient-stated. Today all of it flattens into one sentence. |
| `confirmed_by` | CR 3 | Sender identity comes from the token, so iMed records "the MFU triage system", not the nurse who signed off. Matters for audit after an incident. |
| `source_ref` | CR 4 | Lets your staff open the full transcript and the AI's cited reasoning, not just the summary. |
| `rerouted` | — | We know when a nurse overrode the AI's department. There is no iMed field, so today it can only go into `sbar.recommend` as prose. |

If any of these are accepted we implement them our side and this request
becomes request 1.

*Against our mock this reuses request 1's `request_id`, so it replays request
1's result rather than queueing the patient twice — that is the idempotency
rule working, not the proposed fields being ignored.*

**CR 8 — an idempotency key we cannot query leaves us blind.** If our call
times out we cannot tell whether the assignment landed. Today the only way to
find out is to send it again and interpret the error. A read endpoint turns a
guess into a fact, and enables end-of-day reconciliation against your gateway
logs.

**CR 7 — a duplicate should return the original `result`.** Standard
idempotency behaviour is 200 with the first response replayed. Without it, a
timeout-then-retry leaves the patient queued while the nurse has no queue
number to give them.

**CR 5 — SBAR read-back.** SBAR is currently write-only for us: we get an
`sbar_id` and nothing else. Reading it back lets us show the nurse what was
actually handed over.

*Returns 404 against our mock — deliberately not built, because it is a
request to you, not something we have decided for you.*
